    research had primarily focused on determining constructions and
    decoding of error correcting codes for improving the reliability of
    communication and storage systems. The other focus of my research was on
    determining limits on the best parameters that an error correcting code
    can have.


    <h2 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 3em;">Short version</h2>
    <h3><strong>Construction of codes for nonvolatile (flash)
            memories</strong></h3>
    We considered multilevel flash memories in this work. We provided
    constructions of codes from cosets of linear codes that can provide
    error correction against charge leakage due to aging in flash memory,
    improve rewritability leading to fewer erasure operations, and also
    correct against random errors.
    <h3><strong>Improving reliability of communication over power line
            communications</strong></h3>
    We provide coding and decoding schemes that can help counter the harsh
    noisy environment in a power line communication medium. Communication
    over the power line channel is of interest because of its use in the
    so-called "smart grid".
    The noise characteristics of the power line channel include permanent
    narrowband noise that is present for a long time, impulse noise that is
    a high energy noise present for a short period of time, and
    additionally Gaussian noise and fading.
    <br>
    We introduced a new parameter that helps us determine error correcting
    codes that are optimal for correcting permanent narrowband noise in the
    channel. This extends the analysis of the coded modulation scheme by
    Vinck 2000. We also determined new constructions of efficiently
    decodable permutation codes that are obtained by
    distance-preserving embeddings of the Hamming space into the space of
    all permutation vectors.
    <br>
    To generalize Vinck's construction to codes that are efficiently
    decodable, but whose block lengths are not restricted by the alphabet
    size (for example permutation codes have this restriction), we
    used a coded modulation scheme that uses multitone frequency shift
    keying as the modulation scheme. We showed that by taking products of
    affine codes (a linear code shifted by a constant nonzero vector), it
    is possible to obtain "good" codes that are also efficiently decodable.

    <h3><strong>Construction of optimal sequences for frame
            synchronization</strong></h3>
    Cross-bifix-free codes, useful in frame synchronization, require that
    a prefix of any length of any codeword is not the suffix of any
    codeword. We constructed such codes of nearly optimal size, which
    generalize a previous binary construction to q-ary alphabets and
    arbitrary lengths.
    
    <h3><strong>Construction of optimal linear codes from generalized
        Hadamard matrices</strong></h3>
    We provided construction of q-ary optimal linear codes from generalized
    Hadamard matrices, that are self-complementary, i.e., the all-one
    vector belongs to the code. Optimality is shown with respect to the
    generalized Grey-Rankin bound and the Griesmer bound.
    
    <h3><strong>Bounds and codes in the ordered Hamming space</strong></h3>
    The ordered Hamming metric arises in multiple contexts, including
    numerical integration of functions, parallel fading channels, and
    in the study of linear complexity of periodic sequences.
    <br>
    We provided new bounds, namely, an Elias bound and Linear Programming
    bounds, on the size of codes in the ordered Hamming space. To establish
    the Linear Programming bounds, we established new properties of certain
    multivariate orthogonal polynomials called the multivariate Krawtchouk
    polynomials.
    <br>
    We generalized the notion of near-Maximum Distance Separable codes to
    the ordered Hamming space and to the poset space, and established
    equivalence relations between near-Maximum Distance Separable codes and
    uniform distributions of point sets in the unit cube that are useful
    for numerical integration.

        <div>
            <p>Communication over a power line channel has been a subject of
            study and application since the 1950s. Recent research has been
            focused on two-way communication over this channel. The channel
            characteristics are harsh, with the presence of permanent
            narrowband noise which may be present at a particular frequency
            at all time instances of transmission, impulse noise which may
            be present at all frequencies in a particular time instance,
            fading, and Gaussian noise.

            <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.1528" title="A.J.H. Vinck, Coded Modulation for Power Line Communications, AEU Journal, pp. 45-49, Jan 2000">Vinck
                2000</a>, proposed the use of M-ary frequency shift
            keying modulation, along with the use of permutation codes, in
            which every symbol of the alphabet occurs exactly once in every
            codeword. Each
            symbol of the alphabet is transmitted on a separate frequency.
            This modulation scheme helps to counter the harsh nature of
            this channel; in particular to correct errors arising from the
            permanent narrowband noise and impulse noise.
            The research has since diverged into using
            <i>frequency permutation arrays</i>, in which every symbol of
            the alphabet occurs equal number of times in every codeword,
            <i>constant composition codes</i>, in which every symbol of
            the alphabet occurs a fixed number of times in every codeword,

            There has also been a significant amount of research over the
            past decade in determining permutation codes, frequency
            permutation arrays, and constant composition codes by using
            distance preserving maps from the binary and ternary Hamming
            space. The distance preserving maps ensure that the distance
            between two vectors in the Hamming space is either maintained
            or increased when mapped to the space of permutations,
            frequency permutation arrays, or the constant composition
            space.<br><br>

            301-314, January 2013.<br>
            <p>
            In the works of Versfeld <i>et.al</i> 2005 - 2010, the notion
            of a "same-symbol weight" of a code is introduced. This notion
            captures the maximum frequency of any symbol over all codewords in
            the code. For example, if a code of block length n contains the
            all-zero codeword then the code has the same-symbol weight of
            n, since the zero symbol occurs with frequency n in the
            all-zero codeword.<br><br>
            <strong>Our contribution:</strong>
            In this work we study the space of all vectors that contain
            symbols with frequency at most a fixed number, say, r. This
            space is termed as the <i>bounded symbol weight space.</i> This
            notion is the same notion as the same-symbol weight.
            The space of all vectors that have a symbol with exactly
            a fixed number r, and no symbol occurs more frequently, is
            termed as the <i>constant symbol weight space.</i> We first
            determine the sizes of these symbol weight spaces and then use
            the sizes to estimate the asymptotic form of classical bounds,
            such as the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, Singleton bound, and
            Johnson bound, on the size of codes in these spaces. The
            non-asymptotic versions of these classical bounds are not
            immediate and it
            remains an open question to determine nice analytical
            expressions for them. The primary hurdle in applying the
            classical bounds arises from the fact that the space is not
            ball-homogeneous, i.e., the size of the Hamming balls depends
            on the center.<br><br>
            We also provide new non-asymptotic lower bounds by studying
            the symbol weight spaces as unions of disjoint constant
            composition spaces. We introduce a new distance metric on the
            space of compositions and use this metric to determine lower
            bounds on the size of codes in the symbol weight spaces in
            terms of constant composition codes.<br><br>
            Finally, we study Reed-Solomon codes and show that
            the Gilbert-Varshamov bound on codes in symbol weight spaces
            can be achieved by using subsets of Reed-Solomon codes.</p>

            <p><strong>Our contribution:</strong>
            In the coded modulation scheme of Vinck 2000, the permanent
            narrowband noise typically manifests as the presence of
            a particular
            symbol at all time instances of the transmission.  We extend
            the analysis in Vinck 2000 to more general
            codes by introducing a new parameter that captures the equity
            of symbols in a code.  This parameter is more accurate in
            determining the performance of a code in the presence of
            permanent narrowband noise. Codes which are optimal with
            respect to this parameter are shown to be able to correct more
            narrowband noise than other codes with similar length, size and
            minimum distance parameters.  Permutation codes, injection
            codes, and frequency permutation arrays are special cases of
            such constructions.

            <p> Distance preserving maps (DPMs) from the Hamming space to
            the permutation space have been the subject of much interest
            over the past decade due to their application to power line
            communication channels. However, most of the work has
            concentrated on constructing DPMs from the binary or ternary
            Hamming spaces to the permutation space, such that most of the
            distances between the mapped vectors increase substantially
            after being mapped to the permutation space. Relatively less
            work is present on the
            decoding of the permutation codes thus obtained. The paper by

                 Swart and Ferreira 2007</a> is one instance where
            DPMs from the binary Hamming space to the permutation space
            are constructed with good decoding algorithms for the
            permutation codes.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Our contribution:</strong>
            In this work, we consider distance preserving maps from the
            q-ary Hamming space to the permutation space, for q=2,3 and
            powers of two. The maps are
            constructed such that it is possible to efficiently decode the
            received codewords. The main idea behind the construction of
            the DPMs is to allow the symbols in the q-ary Hamming space to
            be efficiently estimated from the received permutation symbols.
            Decoding algorithms for linear codes is then applied to the
            estimated symbols to obtain the transmitted codeword.
            However, the requirement of efficient decoding comes at a cost,
            - we lose on the rate of the code. We conjecture that our
            method can be extended to DPMs from q-ary Hamming space to the
            permutation space, for any q. This is verified computationally
            for values of q up to eight.

found to be useful in addressing the
problem of narrowband noise disturbance in power line communications.
However, this modulation scheme is restrictive since the number of frequencies used must
be at least as large as the number of symbols in the permutation code.
In this paper, we propose the use of multitone FSK and 
binary matrix codes to overcome this restriction. 
We construct infinite families of efficiently decodable matrix codes
with rates and relative distances bounded away from zero, that uses only
a logarithmic number of frequencies in the length of the code. Simulation results
show that our multitone modulation scheme outperform single-tone modulation schemes.

        We generalize Vinck's construction to codes that are efficiently
        decodable, but whose block lengths are not restricted by the
        alphabet size (for example permutation codes have this
        restriction). We used a coded modulation scheme that uses multitone
        frequency shift keying as the modulation scheme. We showed that by
        taking products of affine codes (a linear code shifted by
        a constant nonzero vector), it is possible to obtain "good" codes
        that can correct all the four types of noises in the power line
        channel, and that simultaneously achieve the following properties:
        they have positive rates, positive relative distances, and their
        lengths are not restricted by the alphabet size. In addition the
        codes have the property that they are systematic and are cosets of
        linear codes, and thereby have efficient decoding algorithms.

            <p>A crucial requirement to reliably transmit information in
            a digital communication system is to establish synchronization
            between the transmitter and the receiver. Synchronization is
            required to determine the start of a symbol as well as to
            determine the start of a frame of data in the received signals.
            The objective in current methods for achieving faster frame
            synchronization is to search for a word within a specified
            Hamming distance of the transmitted synchronization word,
            instead of exactly matching the synchronization word. This
            procedure requires a simultaneous search for a set of
            synchronization words, which has the property that a prefix of
            any length of any word is not the suffix of any word in the
            set.  This property of the set was termed as
            <i>cross-bifix-free</i> in the works of Bajic, <i>et.al</i>
            2003-2007. We term this set as a <i>cross-bifix-free code.</i>

            satisfied a Fibonacci recursion. We extend this construction to
            any lengths and to any alphabet size. The sizes of the binary
            cross-bifix-free codes obtained from our constructions are
            optimal for all small lengths (except for an instance at

            proved by showing that the sizes satisfy a generalized

            Closely connected to the notion of the ordered Hamming space is
            the poset metric space.
            The poset space has been studied for nearly two decades as a
            generalization of the Hamming space and also because of its
            connection to distributions of points in the unit cube for
            numerical integration of functions. Vectors in this space have
            a partial ordering in their coordinate indices.  The distance
            is measured as the sum of the largest nonzero indices in
            a vector. As an example, consider the poset space which has the
            coordinate indices {1,2,3,4} with the ordering 1 &le; 2 &le; 3
            and 4 &le; 3, and consider the vector [1,0,1,0] as an element
            in this space. In this case, the weight of this vector in the
            poset space is three because the element in the third
            coordinate is nonzero and is at index three in the ordering.
            On the other hand the weight of the
            vector [0,0,0,1] is one because the fourth coordinate is at index
            one in the ordering. A special case of the poset metric is the
            ordered Hamming metric in which the coordinates are
            ordered as disjoint chains of equal length.
            To put the Hamming metric in perspective, note that the Hamming
            metric corresponds to having no ordering among the coordinate
            indices, i.e., it is an anti-chain.<br><br>

            <p>Codes which have parameters close to or at the theoretical
            upper bounds are of much interest since they are optimal (or
            close to optimal) for their values of the minimum distance.
            Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes are a famous example of
            such codes, whose minimum distance attains the Singleton upper
            bound. MDS codes in the Hamming space are connected with some
            classical problems in finite geometries related to the
            existence of some extremal configurations in projective
            geometries. MDS codes in the ordered Hamming space are
            equivalent to <i>optimal distributions</i> of points in the unit
            cube. Near MDS codes are codes which have distance just one
            less than the distance of MDS codes.  However, their second
            generalized Hamming weight, which is the minimum support of any
            two-dimensional subcode of a code, coincides with that of the
            MDS codes.<br><br>

            <strong>Our contribution:</strong>
            In this work, we showed that the notion of linear Near MDS codes

            of such codes. In particular,
            we studied the structure of the code simultaneously as a linear
            code and as an <i>ordered orthogonal array</i>. This enabled us
            to establish the weight distribution of the code and provide

            algebra and studied the distances between triplets of points in
            the Hamming space to provide bounds on the family of
            subsets.

            <strong>Our contribution:</strong>
            The Johnson bound for constant weight codes in the binary
            Hamming space is a well known upper bound. It is typically
            proved by averaging over all the distances in the constant
            weight code. We showed that this averaging technique can be
            adapted to provide sharper bounds on constant weight codes.  In
            particular, we provided two new upper bounds which improve the
            existing Johnson bound for a varied range of parameters. The
            first bound is obtained by considering a weighted average of
            the distances in the constant weight code. The second bound is
            obtained by observing that the L2 norm (with uniform measure)
            of a sequence of numbers is at least as large as the L1 norm
            (with uniform measure) of the sequence. These new bounds are
            also valid in the region at or beyond the Johnson radius where
            the Johnson bound does not exist. The values of these new
            bounds are sometimes exact and meet the table of bounds for
            constant weight codes presented in <a

            The techniques we introduced are also adapted to improve
            non-asymptotic Johnson bounds on constant weight codes in the
            q-ary Hamming space.</p>
