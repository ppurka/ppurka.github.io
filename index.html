suffers from errors due to charge leakage, can tolerate limited erasures,
and where erasures have to be performed in large blocks.  We show that
using cosets of a linear code can provide correction against uniform charge
leakage, and can enhance the rewritability of flash memory which leads to
fewer erasures. We introduce two coset coding schemes that are
generalizations of the scheme in Jacobvitz et al. (2013). For the same
worst case rewrite cost, we show that coset codes can encode more
information than rank modulation codes.  The average case performance of
coset codes is demonstrated via numerical simulations. (Click for pdf)">

            title="Single-tone frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation with permutation codes has been
found to be useful in addressing the
problem of narrowband noise disturbance in power line communications.
However, this modulation scheme is restrictive since the number of frequencies used must
be at least as large as the number of symbols in the permutation code.
In this paper, we propose the use of multitone FSK and
binary matrix codes to overcome this restriction.
We construct infinite families of efficiently decodable matrix codes
with rates and relative distances bounded away from zero, that uses only
a logarithmic number of frequencies in the length of the code. Simulation results
show that our multitone modulation scheme outperform single-tone modulation
schemes. (Click for pdf)"><a

    We believe that the new techniques introduced in Chapter 6 are still
    interesting from the viewpoint of algebraic combinatorics, in light of
    the way the intertwining functions are used. See the "Concluding
    Remarks" at the end of Chapter 6.</p>

        <span style="font-size: smaller;">I am a contributor to the Sage
            mathematical software system. My major contributions have been
            to the graphics and coding theory subsystem. I have minor
            contributions to other components of Sage, including
            Latex, linear algebra, and the Sage notebook.

    <p>Hop over to my <a href="https://github.com/ppurka">
    Github page</a> to see some of my programs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ppurka/papers">papers</a> contains
        (and will contain any future) programs written for simulations in
        my publications. The programs are
        written in C, MATLAB, and Sage/Python/Cython.

        Scanning Document to PDF with OCR'd Text</a> contains a description of
        how we can scan documents, run OCR on them, and create a PDF file with
        the OCR text embedded in the file. This procedure of archiving scanned
        documents is very useful when running full desktop search to find
        documents based on their content. I wish I knew how to do this years
        ago!
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ppurka/sage-patches">
        sage-patches</a> contains some pending patches to the Sage
        mathematical software system.
        <br>
        <em>This repository is not updated anymore since Sage has migrated
            to a git based system, from a mercurial based system.

        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ppurka/btex">btex</a>: This
        bash script is used for handling my latex compilation!
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ppurka/quietemerge">quietemerge</a>:
            This bash script is like a wrapper around the Gentoo's package
            update command called emerge, and is used to update my
            <a href="https://www.gentoo.org">
            Gentoo Linux</a> installation. It was released in 2009 in the Gentoo
            forums. Link to its <a href="https://code.google.com/p/quietemerge/">
            Google code page</a>.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ppurka/easy_efl">easy_efl</a>:
        Another bash script which is a fork of a similarly named script. It
        is used to update a system installation of <a
            href="https://www.enlightenment.org">Enlightenment-DR19</a>.
        <br>
        <em>This script is a modified version of the original
            <a href="https://omicron.homeip.net/projects/#easy_efl_sh">
                Easy_EFL.sh</a>. It does not (yet) have all the
            modifications I performed on the previous script called
            <a href="https://github.com/ppurka/easy_efl">Easy_E17.sh</a>
            that was used to update Enlightenment-DR17.<br>
            <b>Update:</b> The scripts easy_efl and easy_e17 are outdated.
                            I am not using Enlightenment anymore.
